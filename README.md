# Thank you

#### Hi Steven

I'm so sad that I didn't get to finish hack reactor before moving out. I wanted some time to hang out with you again. Some personal highlights:
 - Settlers 50% win record
 - Rapping on heinekens
 - Dat tjoes tri-tip
 - toon link
 - Golf
 - In the night... when the sun IS!

I look up to you as a big brother figure. You're kind, un-judging, and COOL! In my time of confusion and existential crisis, you provided constant support and were a shining bacon of encouragement. I honestly don't think I would be where I am already without you. You're partially responsible for making coding cool for me. I look back on the last six months fondly because of you.


#### Into the Future!
Just because we're across the bay doesn't mean we can't see each other anymore. I hope to hangout with you more. (I'll apply for a job at appdynamics .-.)

**Good luck with wedding**, if you need help in general or with building any structures at the last minute I would be eager to help

*Even more thanks to come when I get a job!*
